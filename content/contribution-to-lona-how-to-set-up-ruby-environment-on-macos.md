title: Contribution To Lona and How To Set Up Ruby Environment On macOS
description: Setting up the Ruby Environment for a new project I'm contributing to.

Earlier this week, I was looking at <a href="https://github.com/airbnb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb‚Äôs open source</a> projects, and I discovered a project called Lona.

> Lona is a collection of tools for building design systems and using them to generate cross-platform UI code, Sketch files, and other artifacts. (retried from Lona‚Äôs GitHub repo)

I really loved the idea of this project, so I chose it to be my next project for my open source course. There aren‚Äôt many issues opened, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what‚Äôs a good task to start with. I‚Äôve used a tip from the project‚Äôs README file, which stated:

> If you‚Äôre interested in contributing or using it at your company, feel free to open a GitHub issue or get in touch with me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dvnabbott" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dvnabbott</a>. (Lona README)

So I tweeted to Devin, who is maintaining this project:

He was very kind and helped me to find a good first issue:

Having some experience in open source development, I know how important communication between maintainers and contributors is. I believe that this is the key to building a community around the project and making people want to contribute more in the future. I appreciate his time and help a lot.

Let‚Äôs get back to the project itself. Lona consists of 3 parts:

- <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/Lona#lona-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lona Components</a> ‚Äî A data format, `.component`, for cross-platform components
- <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/Lona#lona-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lona Studio</a> ‚Äî A GUI tool for designing `.component` files, Swift Mac app.
- <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/Lona#lona-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lona Compiler</a> ‚Äî A CLI tool & API for generating UI code from `.component` files, ReasonML

As you can see from the tweets above, I chose Lona Studio for my contribution. I decided to focus on Swift development for the next several months, so I would like to work as much as possible with this language. Also, I found it interesting because I haven‚Äôt worked with Mac apps before, and, as far as I know, macOS development differs a lot from iOS development.

## Setting Up the Project

First of all, I had to set up the project on my machine. It wasn‚Äôt trivial for me because there was one prerequisite that I didn‚Äôt have. In order to build Lona Studio from source, you need the following tools to be installed:

- bundler
- CocoaPods
- Carthage

I had CocoaPods and Carthage installed already on my Mac, but I didn‚Äôt have Bundler, and I haven‚Äôt even heard about it.

> Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed. (retrieved from bundler.io)

I have never touched Ruby before, so I had to set up Ruby environment in order to install Bundler. First, you need to install RVM (Ruby Version Manager). Here are the steps I used for installing it:<br />

_1._ Install GnuPG

```shell
brew install gnupg gnupg2
```

_2._ Install RVM‚Äôs keys

```shell
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
```

_3._ Run verified installation

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s
```

_4._ Unset default Apple‚Äôs Ruby version

```shell
unset GEM_HOME
```

_5._ Load RVM into the Terminal session:

```shell
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

_6._ Disable <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/autolibs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autolibs</a> (you can read more about this feature here)

```shell
rvm disable autolibs
```

_7._ Install OpenSSL

```shell
brew install openssl
```

_8._ Install Ruby version you want to use. I‚Äôll go with 2.4.0.

```shell
rvm install 2.4.0 --with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl`
```

_9._ Make it a default version.

```shell
rvm use 2.4.0 --default
```

_10._ Finally, install Bundler üéâ

```shell

```

That‚Äôs it üòÉ

## Issue

The welcome screen of Lona looks similar to XCode‚Äôs welcome screen, and the maintainers requested a feature, where pressing ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù key on the selected project would open that project. The only way to open the project was to double-click it.

## Implementation

The issue description was very helpful, and it specified the file, which I should look at, and the function I should override.

There was a `RecentProjectList.swift` file that contained the implementation of the list of projects. I wrote a function that would handle ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù press, and open the selected project:

```swift
override func keyDown(with event: NSEvent) {
    let carriageReturnKeyCode = 36
    if event.keyCode == carriageReturnKeyCode {
        onOpenProject?(projects[tableView.selectedRow])
    }
}
```

Basically, I check if the keyCode of the pressed key is equalled to carriage return key code (36). If it is true, I call the function that opens a specified project:

```swift
onOpenProject?(projects[tableView.selectedRow])
```

It was approved by maintainers and successfully merged into `master` ü•≥

However, later Devin noticed that it would crash no rows were selected, so he quickly created a new patch to fix, where he simply added a check for `tableView.selectedRow` to be `‚â•` than `0`:

```swift
if event.keyCode == carriageReturnKeyCode, tableView.selectedRow >= 0
```

Next time, I‚Äôll be more careful and try to catch possible crashes üò¨

Here is the end result of my contribution:

## Summary

It was a nice experience contributing to this project, maintainers are welcome to contributors, and it‚Äôs one of the factors why I‚Äôm going to contribute more to this project.
